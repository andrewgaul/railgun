* Added a README

* Use native Ruby primitives for constructing and parsing message headers.

* Implement the initial version of railgun -- a Ruby library to communicate with
  a nailgun server. The implemented client provides mechanisms to execute a
  command and retrieve its output. However, interactive sessions are not
  supported.
